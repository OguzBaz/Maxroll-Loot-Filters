# Maxroll Loot Filters for Last Epoch
Welcome to Maxroll's repository of loot filters for the game Last Epoch!

Our filters are tailored for each build and are designed to help you manage your loot more efficiently.


# How to use our filters
To use our filters, simply download the .xml file for the filter you want and place it in your Last Epoch game folder. 

If you downloaded the game from steam and have could saves enabled, go to this folder:

```[STEAM_GAME_FOLDER]/steamapps/userdata/[STEAM_USER_ID]/899770/ac/WinAppDataLocalLow/Eleventh Hour Games/Last Epoch/```

Otherwise it will be in this hidden folder:

```[DRIVE]:/Users/[USER_NAME]/AppData/LocalLow/Eleventh Hour Games/Last Epoch/```

Then, in the game's options menu, select the filter from the list of available options.
